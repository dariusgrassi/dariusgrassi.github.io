      <p>
				I am a computer science graduate student at the University of Texas at
				Austin specializing in networked systems and ML-driven optimization.

      <p>
        Prior to UT, I was an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Chicago,
        where I worked with Brent Stephens. During my undergrad, I also spent a
        few months at the Open Networking Foundation (now Intel NEX).

          <p>
            I designed an automated tuning system for zswap compression parameters using PyTorch, employing feature engineering to optimize performance. To evaluate the system, I built a Redis benchmarking pipeline to identify optimal system configurations for runtime. The results demonstrated that the online learned system could discover the optimal configuration in a fraction of the time required by traditional search methods.

          </div>
          <p>
            I prototyped a memory management system for programmable NICs to support cloud applications. This involved implementing various allocation policies using DPDK, a kernel-bypass framework essential for achieving high-throughput packet processing in modern data centers.

          <p>
            I developed a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) implementation of a CNN accelerator, which involved a detailed analysis of its performance and resource utilization. Additionally, I designed optical flow processing accelerators using HLS for an FPGA accelerator streaming platform.

            <span class="project-meta">University of Texas at Austin, 2022</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            I built a custom software switch using DPDK for kernel-bypass processing on a 100 Gbps testbed. A key part of this project was integrating RDMA for high-speed communication and conducting a thorough evaluation of TCP and RDMA performance characteristics to understand their trade-offs.

          </div>
          <p>
            I built a CI/CD pipeline for programmable switch regression testing using Python and Jenkins, which automated the testing process. I also designed and implemented an automated QA infrastructure for 5G UPF testing, a critical step that prevented production slowdowns. To showcase our work, I developed line-rate network monitoring demos using Grafana for industry presentations and contributed to open-source codebases through GitHub and Gerrit code reviews.

          <p>
            I developed traffic generation tools and a benchmarking infrastructure to evaluate programmable switch designs. This work included deploying custom architectures on hardware and using realistic applications to measure their throughput and performance under real-world conditions.
