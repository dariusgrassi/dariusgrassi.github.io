      <p>
        Computer science graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin
        specializing in networked systems and ML-driven optimization.

      <p>
        Previously, I received my B.S. from the University of Illinois Chicago,
        where I worked with Dr. Brent Stephens. During my undergrad, I also
        spent a few months at the Open Networking Foundation working on
        programmable network testing infrastructure.

            <span class="project-meta">University of Texas at Austin, 2024-2025</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Developed an automated tuning system for zswap compression
            parameters using PyTorch and feature engineering. Built a Redis
            benchmarking pipeline for evaluation and optimal configuration
            identification. The online learned system significantly reduced the
            time required to discover optimal configurations compared to
            traditional search methods.

          </div>
          <p>
            Prototyped a memory management system for programmable NICs to
            support cloud applications. Implemented various allocation policies
            using DPDK, a kernel-bypass framework, enabling high-throughput
            packet processing.

          </div>
          <p>
            Developed a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) implementation of a CNN
            accelerator, including performance and resource utilization
            analysis. Also designed optical flow processing accelerators using
            HLS for an FPGA accelerator streaming platform.

            <span class="project-meta">University of Texas at Austin, 2022</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Built a custom software switch using DPDK for kernel-bypass
            processing on a 100 Gbps testbed. Integrated RDMA for high-speed
            communication and conducted a thorough performance evaluation of
            TCP and RDMA trade-offs.

            <span class="project-meta">Open Networking Foundation, 2021</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Developed a CI/CD pipeline for programmable switch regression
            testing using Python and Jenkins to automate testing, catching real
            production slowdowns. Created line-rate network monitoring demos
            using Grafana for industry presentations and contributed to
            open-source codebases via GitHub and Gerrit.

          <p>
            Developed traffic generation tools and benchmarking infrastructure
            to evaluate programmable switch designs. This involved deploying
            custom architectures on hardware and using realistic applications
            to measure throughput and performance under real-world conditions.
