    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://nexthop.ai/">Nexthop AI</a>.
      I specialized in networked systems and ML-driven optimization as a computer science graduate student at the
      University of Texas at Austin.
      Previously, I received my B.S. from the University of Illinois Chicago,
      where I worked with Dr. Brent Stephens. During my undergrad, I also
      spent a few months at the Open Networking Foundation working on
      programmable network testing infrastructure.
